# Neuronal-Calcium-Dynamics
Contains pre-processing and analysis pipelines of neural recording data from two-photon calcium imaging experiments in mice. Original data from simultaneous recordings of thalamic projections and cortical dendrites (Thalamocortical) for processing pipeline example. Open source data is used for decoding pipeline using deep neural networks (DNN).
